# Machine Learning – Spam Classifier

## Using Naive Bayes Classification.

I specifically wanted to learn more about the Naive Bayes Classifier. 

Remember – a classifier is a machine learning model that is used to discriminate different objects based on certain features. A Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic machine learning model that's used for classification, and is based on the Bayes Theorem.

As a brief run-through, using Bayes theorem, we can find the probability of A happening given that B has occurred. B is the evidence and A is the hypothesis. The assumption is that predictors/features are independent; that is, the presence of one particular feature does not affect the other. This is **Naive**. 

I'll be using the Naive Bayes Classifier to determine whether an email corresponds to spam or not. 

For more information on the Naive Bayes Classifier, see this [article](https://medium.com/@srishtisawla/introduction-to-naive-bayes-for-classification-baefefb43a2d).
